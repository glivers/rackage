/**
 * Async Query Result
 *
 * Represents a pending asynchronous MySQL query result.
 * Returned by terminal methods (all, first, count, etc.) when async mode is enabled.
 *
 * How It Works:
 *   1. Query is fired with MYSQLI_ASYNC flag (non-blocking)
 *   2. Terminal method returns MySQLAsync instead of data
 *   3. Call await() when you need the result (blocks until ready)
 *   4. MySQLAsync processes raw result using the provided callback
 *
 * Benefits:
 *   - Fire query early, fetch result later
 *   - Do other work while query runs
 *   - Cleaner code than manual mysqli_poll handling
 *
 * Limitations:
 *   - Single connection = one async query at a time
 *   - Must call await() before starting another async query
 *   - Connection pool needed for true parallelism (future)
 *
 * Usage:
 *   // Fire async query (returns immediately)
 *   $async = PageModel::async()->where('status', 'active')->all();
 *
 *   // Do other work...
 *   $calculation = expensiveOperation();
 *
 *   // Now get the result (blocks until ready)
 *   $pages = $async->await();
 *
 * With Multiple Queries (sequential, same connection):
 *   $a1 = Model::async()->where('id', 1)->first();
 *   $row1 = $a1->await();  // must await before next async
 *
 *   $a2 = Model::async()->where('id', 2)->first();
 *   $row2 = $a2->await();
 *
